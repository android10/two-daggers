Two Daggers Living Together
=========================

This is a sample app that is part of a blog post I have written about how Dagger 1 and Dagger 2 can live together in order to facilitate a potential gradual migration process in big codebases with many contributors.

Local Development
-----------------

Here are some useful Gradle/adb commands for executing this example:

 * `./gradlew clean build` - Build the entire example and execute unit and integration tests plus lint check.
 * `./gradlew installDebug` - Install the debug apk on the current connected devices
 

Code style
